Make sure the results are visible for all datasets. Then, in 1-2 sentences, comment on how these summary statistics compare across groups (datasets).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nFor a reminder of what standard deviation is, refer to May 19th’s textbook reading: IMS chapter 5. This concept is fair game for the midterm. Math details are not needed, but you should understand the big picture idea.\nCorrelation is a new term. We will learn more details about this after the midterm, but the idea is that it measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship. Values range from -1 (perfect negative linear relationship) to 1 (perfect positive linear relationship). Values near 0 have little/no linear trend. This concept will not be tested on the midterm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe datasauRus data is stored in a tibble: this is a special class of data frame used in the tidyverse. All tibbles are dataframes (with some extra features!), but not vice versa. By default, tibbles only print out 10 rows (whereas other dataframes print out all rows).\nThe result of the summarize should have 13 rows. To display all rows, add print(n = 13) as the last step of your pipeline.\n\n\n\nCreate a scatterplot of y versus x and color and facet it by dataset. Then, in 1-2 sentences, briefly discuss how these plots compare across groups (datasets). How does your response in this question compare to your response to the previous question and what does this say about using visualizations and summary statistics when getting to know a dataset?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhen you both color and facet by the same variable, you’ll end up with a redundant legend.

Update the 2020 data frame to make `name` all upper case.

If you choose this option, save the slides as PDF and upload it to your repo as presentation.pdf.\nYou can also use Quarto to make your slides! While we won’t be covering making slides with Quarto in the class, we would be happy to help you with it in office hours. It’s no different than writing other documents with Quarto, so the learning curve will not be steep!\nThe slide deck should be roughly 6 content slides + 1 title slide.

So, just to make sure, let’s look at the midwest data frame one more time.\n\nmidwest\n\n# A tibble: 437 × 28\n     PID county  state  area poptotal popdensity popwhite popblack popamerindian\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;    &lt;int&gt;         &lt;int&gt;\n 1   561 ADAMS   IL    0.052    66090      1271.    63917     1702            98\n 2   562 ALEXAN… IL    0.014    10626       759      7054     3496            19\n 3   563 BOND    IL    0.022    14991       681.    14477      429            35\n 4   564 BOONE   IL    0.017    30806      1812.    29344      127            46\n 5   565 BROWN   IL    0.018     5836       324.     5264      547            14\n 6   566 BUREAU  IL    0.05     35688       714.    35157       50            65\n 7   567 CALHOUN IL    0.017     5322       313.     5298        1             8\n 8   568 CARROLL IL    0.027    16805       622.    16519      111            30\n 9   569 CASS    IL    0.024    13437       560.    13384       16             8\n10   570 CHAMPA… IL    0.058   173025      2983.   146506    16559           331\n# ℹ 427 more rows\n# ℹ 19 more variables: popasian &lt;int&gt;, popother &lt;int&gt;, percwhite &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   percblack &lt;dbl&gt;, percamerindan &lt;dbl&gt;, percasian &lt;dbl&gt;, percother &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   popadults &lt;int&gt;, perchsd &lt;dbl&gt;, percollege &lt;dbl&gt;, percprof &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   poppovertyknown &lt;int&gt;, percpovertyknown &lt;dbl&gt;, percbelowpoverty &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   percchildbelowpovert &lt;dbl&gt;, percadultpoverty &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   percelderlypoverty &lt;dbl&gt;, inmetro &lt;int&gt;, category &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nNow wait a minute - what happened here? I clearly told it to select the county column, and it did! So why is it that, when I went to look at the midwest data frame again, it had all of the columns, not just the one that I selected?\nThe answer is that we never saved midwest back to a variable! By default, R will show the output, but not modify the data frame unless I want it to. Let’s look at a couple ways we can do that:\n\nmidwest &lt;- midwest |&gt;\n  select(county)\n\nmidwest\n\n# A tibble: 437 × 1\n   county   \n   &lt;chr&gt;    \n 1 ADAMS    \n 2 ALEXANDER\n 3 BOND     \n 4 BOONE    \n 5 BROWN    \n 6 BUREAU   \n 7 CALHOUN  \n 8 CARROLL  \n 9 CASS     \n10 CHAMPAIGN\n# ℹ 427 more rows\n\n\nThe first option is to simply overwrite the variable. This is useful if you’re never going to need those data in their original form - it saves you some confusion in that case.\nHowever, what if later on I decide I did need those data after all? Perhaps I wanted population density data. I go to try and find this variable in the midwest data set, because that’s where I know it’s stored…\n\nmidwest |&gt;\n  select(popdensity)\n\nError in `select()`:\n! Can't select columns that don't exist.\n✖ Column `popdensity` doesn't exist.\n\n\n…but the variable is gone! This is a common point of confusion for students in STA 199, so it’s important to understand what you’re doing whenever you modify your data in-place like this - you’re overwriting the existing data.\nWe have a couple of options here. If we were loading these data from a .csv file, we could go back to the top of the document. Or, we could do something more effective: Go to Environment, click the little broom icon, and select “yes”.\n\nmidwest\n\n# A tibble: 437 × 28\n     PID county  state  area poptotal popdensity popwhite popblack popamerindian\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;    &lt;int&gt;         &lt;int&gt;\n 1   561 ADAMS   IL    0.052    66090      1271.    63917     1702            98\n 2   562 ALEXAN… IL    0.014    10626       759      7054     3496            19\n 3   563 BOND    IL    0.022    14991       681.    14477      429            35\n 4   564 BOONE   IL    0.017    30806      1812.    29344      127            46\n 5   565 BROWN   IL    0.018     5836       324.     5264      547            14\n 6   566 BUREAU  IL    0.05     35688       714.    35157       50            65\n 7   567 CALHOUN IL    0.017     5322       313.     5298        1             8\n 8   568 CARROLL IL    0.027    16805       622.    16519      111            30\n 9   569 CASS    IL    0.024    13437       560.    13384       16             8\n10   570 CHAMPA… IL    0.058   173025      2983.   146506    16559           331\n# ℹ 427 more rows\n# ℹ 19 more variables: popasian &lt;int&gt;, popother &lt;int&gt;, percwhite &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   percblack &lt;dbl&gt;, percamerindan &lt;dbl&gt;, percasian &lt;dbl&gt;, percother &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   popadults &lt;int&gt;, perchsd &lt;dbl&gt;, percollege &lt;dbl&gt;, percprof &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   poppovertyknown &lt;int&gt;, percpovertyknown &lt;dbl&gt;, percbelowpoverty &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   percchildbelowpovert &lt;dbl&gt;, percadultpoverty &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   percelderlypoverty &lt;dbl&gt;, inmetro &lt;int&gt;, category &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nNow the second option: let’s try making the modification a little more carefully: saving the data to a new variable.\n\nmidwest_counties &lt;- midwest |&gt;\n  select(county)\n\nmidwest_counties\n\n# A tibble: 437 × 1\n   county   \n   &lt;chr&gt;    \n 1 ADAMS    \n 2 ALEXANDER\n 3 BOND     \n 4 BOONE    \n 5 BROWN    \n 6 BUREAU   \n 7 CALHOUN  \n 8 CARROLL  \n 9 CASS     \n10 CHAMPAIGN\n# ℹ 427 more rows\n\nmidwest\n\n# A tibble: 437 × 28\n     PID county  state  area poptotal popdensity popwhite popblack popamerindian\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;    &lt;int&gt;         &lt;int&gt;\n 1   561 ADAMS   IL    0.052    66090      1271.    63917     1702            98\n 2   562 ALEXAN… IL    0.014    10626       759      7054     3496            19\n 3   563 BOND    IL    0.022    14991       681.    14477      429            35\n 4   564 BOONE   IL    0.017    30806      1812.    29344      127            46\n 5   565 BROWN   IL    0.018     5836       324.     5264      547            14\n 6   566 BUREAU  IL    0.05     35688       714.    35157       50            65\n 7   567 CALHOUN IL    0.017     5322       313.     5298        1             8\n 8   568 CARROLL IL    0.027    16805       622.    16519      111            30\n 9   569 CASS    IL    0.024    13437       560.    13384       16             8\n10   570 CHAMPA… IL    0.058   173025      2983.   146506    16559           331\n# ℹ 427 more rows\n# ℹ 19 more variables: popasian &lt;int&gt;, popother &lt;int&gt;, percwhite &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   percblack &lt;dbl&gt;, percamerindan &lt;dbl&gt;, percasian &lt;dbl&gt;, percother &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   popadults &lt;int&gt;, perchsd &lt;dbl&gt;, percollege &lt;dbl&gt;, percprof &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   poppovertyknown &lt;int&gt;, percpovertyknown &lt;dbl&gt;, percbelowpoverty &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   percchildbelowpovert &lt;dbl&gt;, percadultpoverty &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   percelderlypoverty &lt;dbl&gt;, inmetro &lt;int&gt;, category &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nNow we have two data frames: the new data frame midwest_counties, which contains our modifications from the data pipeline above, and the original data frame midwest, which has not been changed.

But what exactly is the difference?\nDouble/Numeric\nThe dbl data type, which is the default implementation of the numeric class, stands for double - meaning “double-precision floating-point format”. It’s pretty clear that double is an easier word to remember! This allows you to store numbers with a lot of decimal points (but not infinite!). For example, let’s look at \\(\\pi\\), which is built in as pi in R:\n\npi\n\n[1] 3.141593\n\nclass(pi)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n\nHere, we use the class() function to determine what data type R is using to store our variables. In this case, we can see that R stores pi as a default numeric variable, which is implemented as a double. In general, whenever you work with numbers, they will be doubles, and for purposes of STA 199 there is no issue with this.\nInteger\nThe int data type means integer - as in, the mathematical concept of an integer. All data represented as integers will be whole numbers. This data type is not capable of storing decimal places, so if you try to do decimal operations with it, R will implicitly cast it to another data type. Implicitly means that it does this without us telling it to. Let’s take a look at a couple of examples:\n\na &lt;- 3\nclass(a)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n\nBy default, R will treat all numbers as the numeric class. If you want to explicitly tell R that your number is an integer, follow the number with “L”:\n\na &lt;- 3L\nclass(a)\n\n[1] \"integer\"\n\n\nNow, let’s say we want to divide this number by 2:\n\nb &lt;- a / 2\nclass(b)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n\nSince 3 is not divisible by 2, the output is a decimal. However, since we have performed a decimal operation, rather than trying to guess whether to round up or down, R simply implicitly casts it back to numeric.\nLogical/Boolean\nWhile there isn’t an example in this data frame, there is a data type called logical - which represents true/false.\n\nc &lt;- TRUE\nclass(c)\n\n[1] \"logical\"\n\n\nIn R, you need to type out TRUE/FALSE in all caps for it to be recognized. Under the hood, R stores these values as “FALSE = 0” and “TRUE = 1”, which means that if you want to find the percentage of TRUE in your data, you can just take the average:\n\nd &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)\nmean(d)\n\n[1] 0.6666667\n\n\nCharacter/String\nThe chr data type represents all characters and strings in R. Unlike some languages, R does not differentiate between these. In general, strings are used to represent words and categorical data, for example:\n\nplace &lt;- \"Durham, NC\"\nclass(place)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nHowever, there is an important point of caution here. Sometimes, when you load in a data frame, there will be columns that should be represented as numbers, but are accidentally represented as strings. If you’re not careful, this can have consequences. For example, consider the following:\n\n0 == 00\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\"0\" == \"00\"\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nIn R, the numbers 0 and 00 represent the same thing! However, when they are strings, they do not. R treats numbers differently than it does strings, so it’s important to pay attention to which one you are actually implementing. You might also run into issues with some of your operations - for example, if you try to take the average of a column of strings, R has no idea what to do and will throw an error.\nNote: pay attention to the usage of two equal signs here, rather than just one. Why did we do this? (More on this shortly.)",

    "section": "Casting",
    "text": "Casting\nSo what is the solution to this problem? The answer is called casting, which means changing the data type. You do this using the as.character(), as.numeric(), and as.logical() commands. Let’s look at an example:\n\ne &lt;- \"00\"\nclass(e)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\ne\n\n[1] \"00\"\n\ne &lt;- as.numeric(e)\nclass(e)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\ne\n\n[1] 0\n\ne &lt;- as.logical(e)\nclass(e)\n\n[1] \"logical\"\n\ne\n\n[1] FALSE\n\ne &lt;- as.character(e)\nclass(e)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\ne\n\n[1] \"FALSE\"\n\ne &lt;- as.numeric(e) # What happened?\n\nWarning: NAs introduced by coercion\n\ne\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nBe mindful with your casting - you can lose information along the way!\nNote: NA is a specific type in R. It essentially means “nothing” or “this value has not been declared”. You cannot use == to check whether a value is NA. Instead, you must use is.na().",

    "text": "Equals\nThe first Boolean operator is “equals”. This is a place where it is easy to get confused. We use the single equals sign, =, to denote assignment - essentially, telling R “this thing takes this value.” We use the double equals sign, ==, to denote comparison - essentially, asking R “are these two values equal?” It is important to keep these two things distinct - if you want to check equality, or filter for a specific value, you always need to use the double equals sign!\n\nmidwest |&gt;\n  filter(county = \"Cook\")\n\nError in `filter()`:\n! We detected a named input.\nℹ This usually means that you've used `=` instead of `==`.\nℹ Did you mean `county == \"Cook\"`?\n\n\nHere’s an example of where a single equals sign is incorrect, and R returns an error. Fortunately, it has a very helpful suggestion in the error message! Let’s replace that with the double equals:\n\nmidwest |&gt;\n  filter(county == \"Cook\")\n\n# A tibble: 0 × 28\n# ℹ 28 variables: PID &lt;int&gt;, county &lt;chr&gt;, state &lt;chr&gt;, area &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   poptotal &lt;int&gt;, popdensity &lt;dbl&gt;, popwhite &lt;int&gt;, popblack &lt;int&gt;,\n#   popamerindian &lt;int&gt;, popasian &lt;int&gt;, popother &lt;int&gt;, percwhite &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   percblack &lt;dbl&gt;, percamerindan &lt;dbl&gt;, percasian &lt;dbl&gt;, percother &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   popadults &lt;int&gt;, perchsd &lt;dbl&gt;, percollege &lt;dbl&gt;, percprof &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   poppovertyknown &lt;int&gt;, percpovertyknown &lt;dbl&gt;, percbelowpoverty &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   percchildbelowpovert &lt;dbl&gt;, percadultpoverty &lt;dbl&gt;, …\n\n\nNow there’s no error message, but we also didn’t return any values. Why did this happen? When I use ==, I am checking whether these two strings are exactly equivalent, and that includes being case sensitive. If I view the data in the data frame, I see that all of the county names are actually in all caps. I can fix the string in my example…\n\nmidwest |&gt;\n  filter(county == \"COOK\")\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 28\n    PID county state  area poptotal popdensity popwhite popblack popamerindian\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;    &lt;int&gt;         &lt;int&gt;\n1   576 COOK   IL    0.058  5105067     88018.  3204947  1317147         10289\n# ℹ 19 more variables: popasian &lt;int&gt;, popother &lt;int&gt;, percwhite &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   percblack &lt;dbl&gt;, percamerindan &lt;dbl&gt;, percasian &lt;dbl&gt;, percother &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   popadults &lt;int&gt;, perchsd &lt;dbl&gt;, percollege &lt;dbl&gt;, percprof &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   poppovertyknown &lt;int&gt;, percpovertyknown &lt;dbl&gt;, percbelowpoverty &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   percchildbelowpovert &lt;dbl&gt;, percadultpoverty &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   percelderlypoverty &lt;dbl&gt;, inmetro &lt;int&gt;, category &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\n…and finally find Chicago!",

    "text": "Combining Boolean Operators\nYou can also combine multiple Boolean operators in more complex logical statements. We will not look at any examples here, because they can get very confusing, very quickly (and are generally unnecessary for this course). However, if you do want to combine Boolean operators, here are some things to keep in mind:\n\nParentheses: Just like in math, any statements that you put in parentheses will execute first. If I say “A and B or C”, it’s unclear exactly what I mean. If I would accept either (A and B) or (A and C), I would write A & (B | C), meaning I need at least one of B or C to be true. If I would accept either (A and B) or C, I would write (A & B) | C, meaning I need either (A and B) or C to be true.\nOrder of operations: Pay attention to the order in which your statements evaluate! If I write !(A & B), that means I need at least one of A or B to be false. If I write !A & !B, that means I need both A and B to be false. This can get confusing, so it’s best to write out your logic fully and work through a few examples by hand (or avoid layering these operators entirely).",

    "text": "Definition\nWhat is a function? A function is, essentially, a block of code that does something (so that you don’t have to implement it!). A function will always have a name, followed by open and closed parentheses (). Some functions do not take arguments. However, if they do, these arguments will go within the parentheses. Once R sees an opening parenthesis, it will not execute the code until it sees a closing parenthesis. Beware - when you start layering functions, such as using aes() inside of ggplot(), you need to pay attention to what your parentheses are around and make sure that they all close!",

    "section": "Arguments",
    "text": "Arguments\nArguments are the commands that you give to a function that tell it what to do. Most functions take at least one argument, and some can take arbitrarily many. Functions have a default order for (some of) their arguments. If you know this order, you do not have to explicitly name the arguments. If not, you must list them explicitly. Here are two examples:\n\n# Named Arguments\nggplot(\n  data = midwest, \n  mapping = aes(x = poptotal, y = popdensity, color = percwhite)\n  ) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Unnamed Arguments\nggplot(\n  midwest, \n  aes(poptotal, popdensity, percwhite)\n  ) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn ggplot, the first two arguments are always data and mapping, so it is common to drop these. However, in the second plot here, we lost our fill aesthetic. Why?\nWhen we look at the aes() documentation, we see that x is the first named argument and y is the second, but after that there are no named arguments. That means, while you can add more aesthetics, you must name them explicitly, since they do not appear by default.\nPipe Operator\nMany times in this class, you will see the symbol |&gt; used. This is known as the pipe operator, and it allows us to have a so-called “data pipeline”. This helps make code a lot more readable! Let’s take a look at why:\n\nhead(arrange(mutate(select(filter(midwest, state == \"IL\"), county, state, area, poptotal, inmetro), inmetro = as.logical(inmetro)), desc(poptotal)), 10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 5\n   county    state  area poptotal inmetro\n   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;  \n 1 COOK      IL    0.058  5105067 TRUE   \n 2 DU PAGE   IL    0.02    781666 TRUE   \n 3 LAKE      IL    0.028   516418 TRUE   \n 4 WILL      IL    0.05    357313 TRUE   \n 5 KANE      IL    0.029   317471 TRUE   \n 6 ST CLAIR  IL    0.04    262852 TRUE   \n 7 Winnebago IL    0.03    252913 TRUE   \n 8 MADISON   IL    0.045   249238 TRUE   \n 9 MCHENRY   IL    0.036   183241 TRUE   \n10 PEORIA    IL    0.038   182827 TRUE   \n\n\nTechnically, we can write our code in this manner! Strictly speaking, under the hood, the pipe operator is reconstructing your code into this format. However, this is nearly impossible to read (I’ve been coding in R for years, and I still ran into multiple errors trying to write this).\nWith the pipe operator, we can skip this and execute each function on its own line. By default, the pipe operator “pipes” your data into the first argument of a function - which, in the tidyverse, is almost always the “data” argument. This lets us write our data in a much neater pipeline, where you can see step-by-step what is happening to the data:\n\nmidwest |&gt;   # Operate on the midwest data frame\n  filter(state == \"IL\") |&gt;   # Filter for only the counties in Illinois\n  select(county, state, area, poptotal, inmetro) |&gt;   # Select only these five columns, and drop all others\n  mutate(inmetro = as.logical(inmetro)) |&gt;   # Cast inmetro to a logical type\n  arrange(desc(poptotal)) |&gt;   # Arrange the data frame by poptotal in descending order\n  head(10)   # Select the top 10 rows\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 5\n   county    state  area poptotal inmetro\n   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;  \n 1 COOK      IL    0.058  5105067 TRUE   \n 2 DU PAGE   IL    0.02    781666 TRUE   \n 3 LAKE      IL    0.028   516418 TRUE   \n 4 WILL      IL    0.05    357313 TRUE   \n 5 KANE      IL    0.029   317471 TRUE   \n 6 ST CLAIR  IL    0.04    262852 TRUE   \n 7 Winnebago IL    0.03    252913 TRUE   \n 8 MADISON   IL    0.045   249238 TRUE   \n 9 MCHENRY   IL    0.036   183241 TRUE   \n10 PEORIA    IL    0.038   182827 TRUE   \n\n\nMuch better, right? Remember, whenever you’re using the pipe operator (or the +, in ggplot, which is different!), you should start a new line of code. As long as you have a pipe operator, R is expecting another function, so it won’t execute only part of your code.\nNote: In this class, we focus on the base R pipe, which is denoted by |&gt;. However, when you’re debugging on the internet, you may come across the symbol %&gt;%, which is the magrittr pipe. There are some technical differences in these that generally go beyond the scope of this class, but they essentially serve the same purpose. Don’t be scared by the magrittr pipe when you’re doing your debugging!",

The error has something to do with the function stat_count(), but that’s not a function we used (explicitly) anywhere in this code. This is why you should iterate on your code, running it intermittently, so that you can catch errors when they pop up.\nMy first thought would be to run rlang::last_trace(), as suggested by the error message. This is sometimes helpful - it can reference certain functions and even lines of code, especially when you’re executing something more complex. Frequently, though, it’s too complicated to understand. In this case, I would certainly say I can’t make any sense of that.\nMy next thought is to google the error message. It can be a little tricky to know what to google from the error message. You want to look for anything that seems general enough that other people might have asked, but specific enough that it will apply to your situation. Let’s go line by line:\n\n“Error in geom_bar()”: Probably too general to bother googling. There are a lot of possible errors with geom_bar(), and it would take too long to look through them all to get to your specific problem!\n“Problem while computing stat.”: This is more helpful, because it gives a little more direction as to the source of the error, but it is still too general - what stat are we computing? What problem?\n“Error occured in the 1st layer”: This can be helpful for you, if you know the order of ggplot layers. However, it is probably not helpful to google, since people could have built their layers in a different order before encountering this error.\n“Caused by error in setup_params()”: Closer! This is getting more and more specific, and this might be good enough to google. However, it still doesn’t say what the error is, it just says that there was one.\n“stat_count() must only have an x or y aesthetic”: Bingo! This is the one we’re looking for, which tells us exactly what the issue is. Now, it may be possible to interpret manually, but let’s say you can’t. Here’s where we go now:\n\nI would copy-paste the entire final line into google. You don’t want to copy-paste the full error message, since that’s probably too specific, and you might not find any results. At the same time, you don’t want to copy-paste only a couple of words, since that might not be specific enough, and you could be stuck looking through a lot of links. If you google just that line, you are likely to find someone on stack exchange who has posted a question with this exact (or almost this exact) error message. You can also help your google out by throwing in some relevant key words:\n\nggplot\nR\nerror\n\nTake a couple minutes to google this, and see if you can figure out what’s wrong with the code! Then, remember to cite the source where you found this answer! In general, it’s okay to google your error messages for help, but not to use someone else’s solution without credit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s wrong with this code?\n\n\n\n\n\nI looked at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61068031/error-stat-count-can-only-have-an-x-or-y-aesthetic for my answer. There’s a few different suggestions on this page, all of which could be useful! This page definitely suggests to me that the issue with my plot is in the geom_bar() line - which makes sense, since this is layer 1 of the plot. While they have a couple simple fixes, here’s the actual error I wrote: geom_bar() is expecting only one variable. If you want two variables, like this, you should use geom_col() instead.",

Check back later to see if it’s been resolved. If there’s a deadline coming up soon, post on the Ed Discussions to let us know that there’s an issue. We can look into how quickly it might get resolved and decide on what to do about the deadline accordingly.

If there are, install those updates and restart your browser again.\nRequest a restart of your container – To do so, select your container as you usually do and then, instead of Login, click on Request Restart.

    "text": "Course components\n\nLectures and labs\nLectures and labs are designed to be interactive, so you gain experience applying new concepts and learning from each other. My role as instructor is to introduce you to new methods, tools, and techniques, but it is up to you to take them and use them. A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing. Therefore, as much as possible, you will work on various tasks and activities throughout each lecture and lab. You are expected to prepare for class by completing assigned readings, attending lectures and lab sessions, and meaningfully contributing to in-class exercises and discussions. Additionally, most lectures will feature application exercises that will be graded based on completing what we do in class.\nYou are expected to bring a laptop (or Chromebook) to each class so that you can participate in the in-class exercises. Please ensure your device is fully charged before you come to class, as the number of outlets in the classroom will not be sufficient to accommodate everyone. A tablet also works, but the user experience will be much smoother on a laptop.\n\n\nActivities & Assessment\nYou will be assessed based on five components: application exercises, labs, exams, project, and teamwork.\n\nLabs\nIn labs, you will apply what you’ve learned in the videos and during lectures to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss lab assignments with other students; however, the lab should be completed and submitted individually. Lab assignments must be typed up using Quarto, all work must be pushed to your GitHub repository for the lab, and the lab’s PDF output must be submitted on Gradescope by the deadline.\nLabs are due at 11:59pm ET on the indicated due date. Generally, for Monday labs, this is the following Wednesday; for Thursday labs, this is the following Sunday.\nThe lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nExams\nThis course will have two exams: a midterm and a final. The midterm will include an in-class component (with a cheat sheet) and an open-note take-home component, while the final will include only an in-class component (with a cheat sheet).\nYou can demonstrate what you’ve learned in the course thus far through these exams. The exams will focus on both conceptual understanding of the content and application through analysis and computational tasks. The exam’s content will be related to the content in videos and reading assignments, lectures, application exercises, and labs.\nMore details about the exams will be given during the semester.\n\n\nProject\nThe project aims to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting data-driven research question. The project will be completed in teams, and each team will present their work in the last lab session of the semester. The write-up will be due on the same day.\nYou cannot pass this course if you have not completed the project.\nMore information about the project will be provided during the semester.\n\n\nApplication exercises\nParts of some lectures will be dedicated to working on Application Exercises (AEs). These exercises allow you to apply the statistical concepts and code introduced in the preparation materials. These AEs are due by 10:45 am ET on the day of the lecture they are covered. To submit the AEs, you only need to push your work to your GitHub repo.\nBecause these AEs are for practice, they will be graded based on attempt, i.e., a good-faith effort has been made in attempting all parts.\nSuccessful on-time completion of at least 80% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade.",

I intend to present materials and activities that respect diversity and align with Duke’s Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion. Furthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives, and experiences and honors their identities. To help accomplish this:\n\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource.\nI (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If anything was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please let me or a teaching team member know.\n\n\n\nPersonal pronouns\nPronouns are meaningful tools to communicate identities and experiences, and using pronouns supports a campus environment where all community members can thrive. You can update your gender pronouns in Duke Hub and learn more about personal pronouns at the Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity’s website.\n\n\nAccessibility\nIf any portion of the course is not accessible to you due to challenges with technology or the course format, please let me know so we can make appropriate accommodations.\nThe Student Disability Access Office (SDAO) is available to ensure that students can engage with their courses and related assignments. Students should contact the SDAO to request or update accommodations under these circumstances.\n\n\nCommunication\nAll lecture notes, assignment instructions, an up-to-date schedule, and other course materials may be found on the course website: sta199-su25.github.io.\nAnnouncements will periodically be emailed through Canvas Announcements. Please check your email regularly to ensure you have the latest announcements for the course.\n\n\nEmail\nIf you have questions about assignment extensions, accommodations, or any other matter not appropriate for the class discussion forum, please email me directly at marie.neubrander@duke.edu. If you do so, please include “STA 199” in the subject line. Barring extenuating circumstances, I will respond to STA 199 emails within 48 hours, Monday through Friday.

The course team will help you by providing you with materials answering questions, and setting a pace, but for this to work, you must do the following:\n\nComplete all the preparation work before class.\nAsk questions. As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you’re not sure about the lab, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.\nDo the readings!\nDo the lab! The earlier you start, the better. It’s not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example).\nDon’t procrastinate. The content builds upon what was taught in previous weeks, so if something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, etc. Don’t let the week end with unanswered questions. But if you find yourself falling behind and not knowing where to begin asking, come to office hours and work with a member of the teaching team to help you identify a good (re)starting point.",

    "section": "Course policies",
    "text": "Course policies\n\nDuke Community Standard\nAs a student in this course, you have agreed to uphold the Duke Community Standard (video here!) and the practices specific to this course.\n\n\nAcademic honesty\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\nPlease abide by the following as you work on assignments in this course:\n\nCollaboration: Only work that is clearly assigned as teamwork should be completed collaboratively.\n\nYou may discuss lab assignments with other students; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write-up with other students. For team assignments, you may collaborate freely within your team. You may discuss the assignment with other teams; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write-up with another team. Unauthorized sharing (or copying) of the code or write-up will be considered a violation for all students involved.\nYou may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exams. Unauthorized collaboration or using unauthorized materials will be considered a violation for all students involved. More details will be given closer to the exam date.\nCollaboration within teams is not only allowed but expected for the project. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed; however, you may not share code or project components across teams.\nOn individual assignments, you may not directly share work (including code) with another student in this class; on team assignments, you may not directly share work (including code) with another team.\n\nOnline resources: I know that a huge volume of code is available online to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something, the course’s policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g., StackOverflow), but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\nUse of generative artificial intelligence (AI): You should treat generative AI, such as ChatGPT, like other online resources. Two guiding principles govern how to use AI in this course:\n\nCognitive dimension: Working with AI should not reduce your thinking ability. We will practice using AI to facilitate—rather than hinder—learning.\nEthical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and ensure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\n\n AI tools for code: You may use the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. You may use these guidelines to cite AI-generated content. The bare minimum citation must include the AI tool you’re using (e.g., ChatGPT) and your prompt. The prompt you use cannot be copied and pasted directly from the assignment; you must create a prompt yourself.\n AI tools for narrative: Unless instructed otherwise, you may not use generative AI to generate a narrative that you then copy-paste verbatim into an assignment or edit and then insert into your assignment.\n AI tools for learning: You’re welcomed to ask AI tools questions that might help your learning and understanding in this course.\n\nIn general, you may use generative AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content. Identifying AI-generated content is fairly straightforward. Any code identified as AI-generated but not cited as such and any narrative identified as AI-generated will be considered plagiarism and treated as such.\n\nIf you are unsure if using a particular resource complies with the academic honesty policy, please ask a teaching team member.\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is the responsibility of all students to understand and follow all Duke policies, including academic integrity (e.g., completing one’s own work, following proper citation of sources, adhering to guidance around group work projects, and more). Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Duke Community Standard. Any questions and/or concerns regarding academic integrity can be directed to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards at conduct@duke.edu.\nAny violations in academic honesty standards as outlined in the Duke Community Standard and those specific to this course will\n\nautomatically results in a 0 for the relevant portion or the entire assignment,\ncan further impact your overall course grade, and\nwill be reported to the Office of Student Conduct & Community Standards for further action.\n\n\n\nLate work & extensions\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback in a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest lab assignment will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.\n\nLabs may be submitted up to 3 days late. A 5% deduction will be applied for each 24-hour period during which the assignment is late.\nNo late work is accepted for application exercises since these are designed to help you prepare for other assessments in the course.\nNo late work is accepted for exams.\nNo late work is accepted for projects.\n\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nIf circumstances prevent you from completing a lab by the stated due date, you may email the course coordinator, Dr. Mary Knox, before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide an explanation. This waiver may only be used once a semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.\nIf circumstances have a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your academic dean know. They can be a resource. Please let me know if you need help contacting your academic dean.\n\n\nRegrade requests\nRegrade requests must be submitted on Gradescope within a week after an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Regrade requests are also not a mechanism for asking for clarification on feedback, those questions should be brought to office hours. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire assignment may be regraded, which could potentially result in losing points.\nNo grades will be changed after the final exam has been administered.\n\n\nAttendance policy\nEvery student is expected to attend and participate in lecture and labs. There may be times, however, when you cannot attend class. If you miss a lecture, make sure to review the material and complete the application exercise, if applicable, before the next lecture. Labs are dedicated to completing the lab assignment and collaborating with your classmates and lab instructor. If you miss a lab session, make sure to communicate with your lab instructor about how you can make up your contribution. If you know you’re going to miss a lab session and you’re feeling well enough to do so, notify your lab TA and teammates ahead of time.\nMore details on Trinity attendance policies are available here.",

    "text": "TL;DR: Ask a question you’re curious about and answer it with a dataset of your choice. This is your project in a nutshell.\nThe project for this course will consist of analysis on a dataset of your own choosing. The dataset may already exist, or you may collect your own data using a survey or by conducting an experiment. You can choose the data based on your teams’ interests or based on work in other courses or research projects. The goal of this project is for you to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this course (and beyond, if you like) and apply them to a novel dataset in a meaningful way.\nThe goal is not to do an exhaustive data analysis i.e., do not calculate every statistic and procedure you have learned for every variable, but rather let me know that you are proficient at asking meaningful questions and answering them with results of data analysis, that you are proficient in using R, and that you are proficient at interpreting and presenting the results. Focus on methods that help you begin to answer your research questions. You do not have to apply every statistical procedure we learned. Also, critique your own methods and provide suggestions for improving your analysis. Issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data, and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should be discussed here.\nThe project is very open ended. You should create some kind of compelling visualization(s) of this data in R. There is no limit on what tools or packages you may use but sticking to packages we learned in the course is required. You do not need to visualize all of the data at once. A single high-quality visualization will receive a much higher grade than a large number of poor-quality visualizations. Also pay attention to your presentation. Neatness, coherency, and clarity will count. All analyses must be done in RStudio, using R, and all components of the project must be reproducible (with the exception of the slide deck).\nYou will work on the project with your lab teams.\nThe four milestones for the final project are\n\nMilestone 1 - Working collaboratively\nMilestone 2 - Proposals, with three dataset ideas\nMilestone 3 - Improvement and progress\nMilestone 4 - Peer review, on another team’s project\nMilestone 5 - Presentation with slides and a reproducible project write-up of your analysis, with a draft along the way.\n\nYou will not be submitting anything on Gradescope for the project. Submission of these deliverables will happen on GitHub and feedback will be provided as GitHub issues that you need to engage with and close. The collection of the documents in your GitHub repo will create a webpage for your project. To create the webpage go to the Build tab in RStudio, and click on Render Website.",

You are encouraged to attend office hours during the times posted on the home page to ask questions about the course content and assignments. Many questions are most effectively answered in person, so office hours are a valuable resource. I encourage each and every one of you to take advantage of this resource! Make a pledge to stop by during office hours at least once during the first three weeks of class. If you have no questions, stop by and say hi and introduce yourself. You can find a list of everyone’s office hours here.\nMy office hours will start in Week 1, TA office hours will start in Week 2.\n\n\nEd Discussion\nHave a question that can’t wait for office hours? Prefer to write out your question in detail rather than asking in person? The course discussion forum, Ed Discussion, is the best venue for these! There is a chance another student has already asked a similar question, so please check the other posts on before asking a new question. If you know the answer to a question that is posted, I encourage you to respond!\nYou can access this tool on the course website toolbar – just click on the lifesaver icon.\n\n\nPeer tutoring\nMINT Peer Tutoring (Meaningful Interactive Tutoring) are small groups of 2-5 students in the same course who meet weekly with a Peer Tutor. This semester, Peer Tutor who will be leading MINT Peer Tutoring for STA 199 is Stanley Borden (stanley.borden@duke.edu).\nThe peer tutoring groups are a resource focused on allowing students to receive additional support for questions they have on the course content while still being part of a community of fellow learners. Peer tutors communicate with students in advance of the meetings so that they can be responsive to student needs during the group meetings. Some groups meet in person and some meet virtually.\n\nIn person, Wednesday 7:00 pm\nVirtual, Wednesday 8:05 pm\n\nFor more details and to see what other courses we offer services for, please visit their website: https://arc.duke.edu/peer-education\nSignups for MINT Peer Tutoring open the morning of Thursday, September 5th and groups start meeting on Monday, September 9th.\nNote that peer tutors are not directly affiliated with the course, however they tend to be students who have taken the course in the past."

    "text": "Can I use a local install of R and RStudio instead of using the RStudio containers?\nThe short answer is, I’d rather you didn’t, to save yourself some headache. But, the long answer is, sure! But you will need to install a specific versions of R and RStudio for everything to work as expected. You will also need to install the R packages we’re using as well as have Git installed on your computer. These are not extremely challenging things to get right, but they are not trivial either, particularly on certain operating systems. Myself and the TAs are always happy to provide help with any computational questions when you’re working in the containers we have provided for you. If you’re working on your local setup, we can’t guarantee being able to resolve your issues, though we’re happy to try.\nIf you want to take this path, here is what you need to do:\n\nDownload and install R 4.4.1: https://cran.r-project.org/\nDownload and install RStudio: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\nInstall Quarto 1.5.56 or higher: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/\nInstall Git: https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html\nInstall any necessary packages with install.packages(\"___\")\n\nAnd I’d like to reiterate again that successful installation of these software is not a learning goal of this course. So if any of this seems tedious or intimidating in any way, just use the computing environment we have set up for you. More on that here."

Make sure to set informative titles and axis labels for your plot. Then, using information as needed from the box plot as well as the histogram from Question 1, describe the distribution of population density of counties and comment on any potential outliers, making sure to identify at least one county that is a clear outlier by name in your narrative and commenting on whether it makes sense to you that this county is an outlier. You can use the data viewer to identify the outliers interactively, you do not have to write code to identify them.\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message “Added answer for Question 2”.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\nQuestion 3\nCreate a scatterplot of the percentage below poverty (percbelowpoverty on the y-axis) versus percentage of people with a college degree (percollege on the x-axis), where the color and shape of points are determined by state. Make sure to set informative titles, axis, and legend labels for your plot. First, describe the overall relationship between percentage of people with a college degree and percentage below poverty in Midwestern states, making sure to identify at least one county that is a clear outlier by name in your narrative. You can use the data viewer to identify the outliers interactively, you do not have to write code to identify them. Then, comment on whether you can identify how this relationship varies across states.\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message “Added answer for Question 3”.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\nQuestion 4\nNow, let’s examine the relationship between the same two variables, once again using different colors and shapes to represent each state, and using a separate plot for each state, i.e., with faceting with facet_wrap(). In addition to points (geom_point()), represent the data with a smooth curve fit to the data with geom_smooth() with the argument se = FALSE. Make sure to set informative titles, axis, and legend labels for your plot. Which plot do you prefer - this plot or the plot in Question 3? Briefly explain your choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nse = FALSE removes the confidence bands around the line. These bands show the uncertainty around the smooth curve. We’ll discuss uncertainty around estimates later in the course and bring these bands back then.\n\n\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message “Added answer for Question 4”.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\nQuestion 5\nDo some states have counties that tend to be geographically larger than others?\nTo explore this question, create side-by-side boxplots of area (area) of a county based on state (state). How do typical county area sizes compare across states? How do variabilities of county sizes compare across states? Which state has the single largest county? Identify the name of this county. You can use the data viewer to identify it interactively, you do not have to write code.\n\nNow is another good time to render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with a meaningful commit message.\nOnce again, make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterwards.\n\nQuestion 6\nDo some states have a higher percentage of their counties located in a metropolitan area?\nCreate a segmented bar chart with one bar per state and the bar filled with colors according to the value of metro – one color indicating Yes and the other color indicating No for whether a county is considered to be a metro area. The y-axis of the segmented barplot should range from 0 to 1, indicating proportions. Compare the percentage of counties in metro areas across the states based on this plot. Make sure to supplement your narrative with rough estimates of these percentages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\nFor this question, you should begin with the data wrangling pipeline below. We will learn more about data wrangling in the coming weeks, so this is a mini-preview. This pipeline creates a new variable called metro based on the value of the existing variable called inmetro. If the value of inmetro is equal to 1 (inmetro == 1), it sets the value of metro to \"Yes\", and if not, it sets the value of metro to \"No\". The resulting data frame is assigned back to midwest, overwriting the existing midwest data frame with a version that includes the new metro variable.\n\nmidwest &lt;- midwest |&gt;\n  mutate(metro = if_else(inmetro == 1, \"Yes\", \"No\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother Hint\n\n\n\nThis question might be a bit tricky - IMS section 4.1 has good conceptual advice and R4DS section 9.6 has some good coding advice. You might notice that this chapter has lots of other coding tips - feel free to take a look (a lot of it is helpful!), but don’t freak out - you do not need to read this whole chapter.\n\n\n\nNow is another good time to render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with a meaningful commit message.\nAnd once again, make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\nWe keep repeating this because it’s important and because we see students forget to do this. So take a moment to make sure you’re following along with the version control instructions.\n\nQuestion 7\nRecreate the plot below, and then give it a title. Then, identify at least one county that is a clear outlier in Wisconsin (WI) by name. You can use the data viewer to identify them interactively, you do not have to write code. Comment on the population composition of this county by investigating the percentage of other races living there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ggplot2 reference for themes will be helpful in determining the theme.\nThe size of the points is 2.\nThe transparency (alpha) of the points is 0.5.\nYou can put line breaks in labels with \\n.\n\n\n\n\nRender, commit, and push your final changes to GitHub with a meaningful commit message.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterwards."

In a few sentences, describe the patterns you observe in the plot, particularly focusing on anything you find surprising or not surprising, based on your knowledge (or lack thereof) of these countries.\nRequirements for the plot:\n\nData should be represented with points as well as lines connecting the points for each country (Note: lines should be directly connecting points, not smooth through them).\nEach country should be represented by a different color line and different color and shape points.\nAxes and legend should be properly labeled.\nThe plot should have an appropriate title (and optionally a subtitle).\nPlot should be customized in at least one additional way – you could use a different than default color scale, or different than default theme, or some other customization."

I am adding code that creates a categorical variable called garage that has two levels: Garage or No garage. Our new variable equals \"Garage\" if the word \"Garage\" is detected in the parking variable and equals \"No garage\" if not.\nYou do not need to understand this code yet - we will learn how to write things like this in the coming days! For now, just run the code!\n\nduke_forest = duke_forest |&gt;\n  mutate(garage = if_else(str_detect(parking, \"Garage\"),   \"Garage\", \"No garage\"))\n\nWhat did this do?\nGo ahead and look at the data again to see the change."
