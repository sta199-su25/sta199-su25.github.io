# Exam reminders

## Basic facts

Worth 20% of your final grade; consists of two parts:

-   **In-class**: worth 70% of the Midterm 1 grade;

    -   Thursday February 20 11:45 AM - 1:00 PM;
    -   Take note of your room assignment!
    -   All multiple choice;
    -   Both sides of one 8.5" x 11" sheet of notes.

-   **Take-home**: worth 30% of the Midterm 1 grade.

    -   Released Thursday February 20 at 1:00 PM;
    -   Due Monday February 24 at 8:30 AM;
    -   Works just like a mini-lab, only zero collaboration.

## Last week's advice

When the world was your oyster and you had nothing but time...

-   **Practice problems**: released Thursday February 13;
-   **Attend lab**: Kahoot on Monday February 17;
-   **Old labs**: correct parts where you lost points;
-   **Old AEs**: complete tasks we didn't get to and compare with key;
-   **Code along**: watch these videos specifically;
-   **Textbook**: odd-numbered exercises in the back of Chs. 1, 4, 5, 6.

## This week's advice

Now that you only have forty-eight hours...

-   Study the Kahoot and the practice problems;
-   Study the Lab 4 solutions;
-   Spend some serious time with your cheat sheet;
-   Study old AE keys, and work stuff we didn't complete.

## What if we get snowed out?

-   **If classes are canceled**: in-class exam is moved to 2/25;

-   **If classes are not canceled**: in-class exam is 2/20 as planned;

-   Take-home exam is the same regardless;

-   If classes are canceled, Testing Center appointments are canceled, and we'll cross that bridge when we come to it (it will be a mess).

# Misrepresentation

## Misrepresenting data science results

Some common ways people do this, either intentionally or unintentionally, include:

::: incremental
-   Claiming **causality** where it's not in the scope of inference of the underlying study

-   Distorting **axes and scales** to make the data tell a different story

-   Visualizing **spatial areas instead of human density** for issues that depend on and affect humans

-   Omitting **uncertainty** in reporting

-   **Volunteers** were **asked** about their physical activity level over the preceding year.
-   Half exercised less than about 150 minutes per week, half exercised more.
-   Compared to the bottom 10% of exercisers, the top 10% had lower rates of esophageal, liver, lung, endometrial, colon, and breast cancer.
-   Researchers found no association between exercising and 13 other cancers (e.g. pancreatic, ovarian, and brain).

# Algorithmic bias

## California Proposition 25 (2020) {.medium}

Popular referendum on 2018's Senate Bill 10:

::: incremental
-   **YES**: replace cash bail with \`\`risk assessment.''

    -   Democratic Party, Governor Gavin Newson, League of Women Voters of California, California Medical Association, Democracy for America (progressive PAC), etc.

-   **NO**: keep the cash bail system.

    -   Republican Party, American Bail Coalition, ACLU of Southern California, NAACP, California Asian Pacific Chamber of Commerce, etc.

-   If passed, each county would be empowered to develop a tool that predicts the risk of a suspect reoffending before trial.

-   Judges would consult this prediction to make bail decisions.
:::

## What might "risk assessment" look like?

Something we will study after spring break:

```{r}
#| message: false
#| echo: false
set.seed(20)
n <- 20
cloud1 <- mvrnorm(n, c(-0.5, -0.5), matrix(c(1, 0.5, 0.5, 1), 2, 2))
cloud2 <- mvrnorm(n, c(0.5, 0.5), matrix(c(1, -0.5, -0.5, 1), 2, 2))
X <- rbind(cloud1, cloud2)
y <- c(rep(0, n), rep(1, n))
fit <- glm(y ~ X, family = binomial)

b0 <- fit$coefficients[1]
b1 <- fit$coefficients[2]
b2 <- fit$coefficients[3]

p_thresh <- 0.5

# compute intercept and slope of decision boundary
bd_incpt <- (log(p_thresh / (1 - p_thresh)) - b0) / b2
bd_slp <- -b1 / b2

x_for_poly <- seq(-5, 5, length.out = 500)
y_for_poly <- bd_incpt + bd_slp * x_for_poly

par(mar = c(4, 5, 0.5, 0.5))
plot(X, 
     pch = 19, 
     col = c(rep("orange", n), rep("blue", n)),
     xlab = expression(x[1]),
     ylab = expression(x[2]),
     xlim = c(-4, 4),
     ylim = c(-4, 4),
     cex.lab = 2)
abline(a = bd_incpt, b = bd_slp, lty = 2, lwd = 3)
polygon(c(x_for_poly, rev(x_for_poly)), c(y_for_poly, rep(5, 500)), col = rgb(0, 0, 1, alpha = 0.2), border = NA)
polygon(c(x_for_poly, rev(x_for_poly)), c(y_for_poly, rep(-5, 500)), col = rgb(1, .5, 0, alpha = 0.2), border = NA)
legend("left", expression(hat(y)~" = 0"), text.col = "orange", bty = "n", cex = 2)
legend("right", expression(hat(y)~" = 1"), text.col = "blue", bty = "n", cex = 2)
points(X, pch = 19, 
     col = c(rep("orange", n), rep("blue", n)))
```

Above the line means high risk means no bail. Is this progress?

> In forecasting who would re-offend, the algorithm made mistakes with black and white defendants at roughly the same rate but in very different ways.

> -   The formula was particularly likely to falsely flag black defendants as future criminals, wrongly labeling them this way at almost twice the rate as white defendants.
>
> -   White defendants were mislabeled as low risk more often than black defendants.

## Predicting ethnicity {.small .scrollable}

[Improving Ecological Inference by Predicting Individual Ethnicity from Voter Registration Record](https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/research/race.html) (Imran and Khan, 2016)

> In both political behavior research and voting rights litigation, turnout and vote choice for different racial groups are often inferred using aggregate election results and racial composition. Over the past several decades, many statistical methods have been proposed to address this ecological inference problem. We propose an alternative method to reduce aggregation bias by predicting individual-level ethnicity from voter registration records. Building on the existing methodological literature, we use Bayes’s rule to combine the Census Bureau’s Surname List with various information from geocoded voter registration records. We evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology using approximately nine million voter registration records from Florida, where self-reported ethnicity is available. We find that it is possible to reduce the false positive rate among Black and Latino voters to 6% and 3%, respectively, while maintaining the true positive rate above 80%. Moreover, we use our predictions to estimate turnout by race and find that our estimates yields substantially less amounts of bias and root mean squared error than standard ecological inference estimates. We provide open-source software to implement the proposed methodology. The open-source software is available for implementing the proposed methodology.

## **wru** package

## California Prop 25 did not pass

The cash bail system was retained:

| Choice | Votes         | Percent |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| Yes    | 7,232,380     | 43.59%  |
| **No** | **9,358,226** | 56.41%  |

::: incremental
-   reasonable people can debate if this outcome is good or bad;
-   every Californian was invited to decide whether statistics and data science should be deployed to make decisions with major social consequences. They opted out;
-   This vote was held in the pre-ChatGPT era. What would the outcome be today? Is the case for **YES** stronger or weaker?

## Another algorithmic decision...

-   Researchers didn't release the real names and pictures of OKCupid users, but their identities could easily be uncovered from the details provided, e.g. usernames
