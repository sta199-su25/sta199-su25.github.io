## Reminders {.smaller}

-   I have office hours today!
    1:00-3:00 PM in Old Chemistry 203/203B.

-   We will start grading your ae repositories next week - make sure you have them ready to go.

-   First 'real' lab is on Monday; the topic will be data visualization (what we are starting today).

## Outline {.smaller}

-   Last time:

    -   We introduced you to the course toolkit.

    -   You **cloned** your `ae` repositories and started making some updates in your Quarto documents.

    -   You **commited and pushed** your changes back.

. . .

-   Today:

    -   We will introduce data visualization.

    -   You will **pull** to get today's application exercise file.

    -   You will work on the new application exercise on data visualization, **commit** your changes, and **push** them.

# From last time

## `ae-01-meet-the-penguins`

::: appex
Go to RStudio, confirm that you're in the `ae` project, and open the document `ae-01-meet-the-penguins.qmd`.
:::

## Common problems: {.smaller}

-   The environment used by Quarto ***when rendering*** starts EMPTY - it does *not see* what *you see* in your environment.
    \

-   Using functions that cause a popup (like `View()` ) are *not going to work* when you render a document.
    Either use a comment (with `#`) to remove them, or just delete before rendering!\

-   Make sure you commit and then PUSH!
    Just committing is not enough!

# Data visualization

## Thoughts on this plot?

![](images/02/female-heights.png)

## More Penguins {.smaller}

![](images/02/peng_plot.png)

## Start plotting!

How can you create something like this???

<br>

If there is one thing you take away from today: We ❤️ `ggplot()` !

## Load packages

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
```

## Look at the data

![](images/df.png)

## Visualize the data

What are some steps you can take to visualize a data set?

-   What do you want on the x-axis?

-   What do you want on the y-axis?

## Step 1. Prepare a canvas for plotting

```{r}
#| fig-width: 9
#| fig-height: 3

ggplot(data = penguins)
```

## Step 2. Map variables to aesthetics {.smaller}

*Map* `year` to the `x` *aesthetic*

```{r}
#| fig-width: 9
#| fig-height: 3
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm))
```

## Step 3. Map variables to aesthetics {.smaller}

*Map* `percent_yes` to the `y` *aesthetic*

```{r}
#| fig-width: 9
#| fig-height: 3
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g))
```

## So... what are aesthetics?? {.smaller}

-   **Aesthetics** are visual properties of a plot that are mapped to from **variables**

-   Some common aesthetics:

    -   **x** and **y** axes

    -   color

    -   fill

    -   size

    -   shape

## Argument names {.smaller}

It's common practice in R to omit the names of first two arguments of a function:

. . .

-   Instead of

``` r
ggplot(data = your_data, mapping = aes(x = x_variable, y = y_variable))
```

-   Use

``` r
ggplot(your_data, aes(x = x_variable, y = y_variable))
```

## Step 4. Represent data on your canvas {.smaller}

with a `geom`

```{r}
#| fig-width: 9
#| fig-height: 3
ggplot(penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point()
```
## Step 4. Represent data on your canvas {.smaller}

-   Adding `geom_point()` resulted in the following warning:

```         
Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale
range (`geom_point()`)
```

## Step 5. Map variables to aesthetics {.smaller}

*Map* `species` to the `color` *aesthetic*

```{r}
#| fig-width: 9
#| fig-height: 3
#| warning: false
ggplot(penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Step 6. Represent data on your canvas {.smaller}

with another `geom`

```{r}
#| fig-width: 9
#| fig-height: 3
ggplot(penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

## Warnings and messages

-   Adding `geom_smooth()` resulted in the following warning:

```         
`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'
```

. . .

-   It tells us the type of smoothing ggplot2 does under the hood when drawing the smooth curves that represent trends for each species.

. . .

-   Going forward we'll suppress this warning to save some space.

## Step 7. Split plot into facets  {.smaller}

When you hear 'facet', think 'sub-plots'!

```{r}
#| fig-width: 9
#| fig-height: 3
#| warning: false
ggplot(penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~island)
```

## Step 7. Split plot into facets  {.smaller}

You have options!

```{r}
#| fig-width: 9
#| fig-height: 3
#| warning: false
ggplot(penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~species)
```

## A note on facets: {.smaller}

More is not always better!
Which plot do you think made it easier to compare between penguin species?

```{r}
#| fig-width: 9
#| fig-height: 3
#| warning: false
ggplot(penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() 
```

## Step 8. Use a different color scale

```{r}
#| fig-width: 9
#| fig-height: 3
#| warning: false
ggplot(penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_color_canva()
```

## Step 8. Use a different color scale

```{r}
#| fig-width: 9
#| fig-height: 3
#| warning: false
ggplot(penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_color_colorblind()
```

## Step 9. Apply a different theme

```{r}
#| fig-width: 9
#| fig-height: 3
#| warning: false
ggplot(penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_color_colorblind() +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Step 9. Apply a different theme

```{r}
#| fig-width: 9
#| fig-height: 3
#| warning: false
ggplot(penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_color_colorblind() +
  theme_classic()
```

## Step 9. Apply a different theme

```{r}
#| fig-width: 9
#| fig-height: 3
#| warning: false
ggplot(penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_color_colorblind() +
  theme_solarized()
```

## Step 9. Apply a different theme

```{r}
#| fig-width: 9
#| fig-height: 3
#| warning: false
ggplot(penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_color_colorblind() +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Step 10. Add labels

```{r}
#| fig-width: 9
#| fig-height: 3
#| warning: false
ggplot(penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_color_colorblind() +
  labs(x = "Bill Length (mm)", y = "Body Mass (g)", color = "Species", title = "Penguin Body Mass vs. Bill Length")
```


## Step 11. Set transparency of points

with `alpha`

```{r}
#| fig-width: 9
#| fig-height: 3
#| warning: false
ggplot(penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_color_colorblind() +
  labs(x = "Bill Length (mm)", y = "Body Mass (g)", color = "Species")
```

## Step 11. Set transparency of points
with `alpha`

```{r}
#| fig-width: 9
#| fig-height: 3
#| warning: false

ggplot(penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_color_colorblind() +
  labs(x = "Bill Length (mm)", y = "Body Mass (g)", color = "Species")
```

## Step 12. Hide standard errors of curves

with `se = FALSE`

```{r}
#| fig-width: 9
#| fig-height: 3
#| warning: false
ggplot(penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  scale_color_colorblind() +
  labs(x = "Bill Length (mm)", y = "Body Mass (g)", color = "Species")
```

## How am I supposed to remember all of this?! {.smaller}

***You aren't!!!***

-   It's important to (eventually) know and remember the key ideas: what does changing a theme do?
    What are aesthetics?
    What is a geom?

-   You do *not* need to memorize a comprehensive list of *all* of the different geoms, themes, color scales, etc.

-   There will be a few fundamentals we expect you to know - more on that later!

## Grammar of graphics {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
We built a plot layer-by-layer

-   just like described in the book *The Grammar of Graphics* and
-   implemented in the **ggplot2** package, the data visualization package of the tidyverse.

# Application exercise

What if we want to use our own data?

-   `read_csv("data_file.csv")` (assuming the data is in a CSV format)

# Application exercise

## `ae-02-bechdel-dataviz` {.smaller}

::: appex
-   Go to your `ae` project in RStudio.
-   Make sure all of your changes up to this point are committed and pushed, i.e., there's nothing left in your Git pane.
-   If you haven't yet done so, click **Pull** to get today's application exercise file.
-   Work through the application exercise in class, and **render, commit, and push** your edits by the end of class.

## Recap {.smaller}

-   Construct plots with `ggplot()`.
-   Layers of ggplots are separated by `+`s.
-   The formula is (almost) always as follows:

```{r}
#| eval: false 

ggplot(DATA, aes(x = X-VAR, y = Y-VAR, ...)) +
  geom_XXX() 
```

## Coming Up... {.smaller}

-   What are some other types of plots you can make?

-   How can you talk about the information conveyed by plots?
