-   Something you plan to do this summer

## Meet data science

<br><br>

Data science is an exciting discipline that allows you to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge.

# Software

## Excel - not...

# Course overview

## Activities {.smaller}

-   Introduce new content and prepare for lectures by watching the videos and completing the readings
-   Attend and actively participate in lectures and labs, office hours, team meetings
-   Practice with application exercises during lecture
-   Use what you've learned to analyze real-world data
    -   Lab assignments x 6
    -   Exams x 2
    -   Term project

## Application exercises

-   Daily-ish in lecture

-   "Graded" for attempt, not accuracy

-   Practice this week; graded thereafter

-   At least one commit by 10:45am of the day of lecture

-   Turn in at least 80% for full credit

## Labs

-   Monday and Thursday; right after lecture

-   Start in lab session, complete at home

-   Due dates (typically):

    -   Monday Lab: Due Wednesday at 11:59 PM

    -   Thursday Lab: Due Sunday at 11:59 PM

-   Discussion with classmates = ü§© ; Copying = ‚ùå

-   Lowest score dropped

## Exams {.smaller}

-   Two exams, each 20%

-   Midterm (June 3) has two parts:

    -   In class: 75 minute in-class exam.
        Closed book, one sheet of notes ("cheat sheet") -- 70% of the grade

    -   Take home: After the in class exam; analyze a dataset -- 30% of the grade

-   Final (June 26): Closed book, one sheet of notes ("cheat sheet").

::: callout-caution
Exam dates cannot be changed.
If you cannot take the exams on these dates, please have a discussion with me ***today***.
:::

## Project {.smaller}

-   Dataset of your choice, method of your choice

-   Teamwork

-   Presentation and write-up

-   Presentations in the last lab (June 23)

-   Interim deadlines, peer review on content, peer evaluation for team contribution

-   Some lab sessions allocated to project progress

::: callout-caution
Final presentation date cannot be changed; you must complete the project to pass this class.
:::

## Teams {.smaller}

-   Assigned by me
-   Project
-   Peer evaluation during teamwork and after completion
-   Expectations and roles
    -   Everyone is expected to contribute equal *effort*
    -   Everyone is expected to understand *all* code turned in
    -   Individual contribution evaluated by peer evaluation, commits, etc.

## Grading {.smaller}

| Category              | Percentage |
|-----------------------|------------|
| Labs                  | 30%        |
| Project               | 20%        |
| Exam 1                | 20%        |
| Exam 2                | 20%        |
| Application Exercises | 5%         |
| Lab attendance        | 5%         |

# Course policies

## Late work, waivers, regrades policy

-   We have policies!
-   Read about them on the [course syllabus](https://sta199-su25.github.io/syllabus/) and refer back to them when you need it

::: callout-note
## If you need testing accommodations

Make sure I get a letter, and make your appointments in the Testing Center now.
:::

## Collaboration

-   **Labs**: discussing and helping is fine.
    Sharing your solutions and copying others is not;

-   **Exams**: collaboration of any kind is completely forbidden on any part of any exam;

-   **Projects**: collaboration of any kind is enthusiastically encouraged *within your team*.
    Between teams, it's the same as labs; do not directly share your stuff or copy off of others.

## Use of AI tools

-   {{< fa check >}} **AI tools for code:**

    -   Sure, but be careful/critical! Working code `!=` correct/good code.
    -   Must explicitly cite with a direct url linking to the conversation you had.

-   {{< fa ban >}} **AI tools for narrative:** Absolutely not!

-   {{< fa check >}} **AI tools for learning:** Sure, but be careful/critical!

## Academic integrity {.smaller}

> To uphold the Duke Community Standard:
>
> -   I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
>
> -   I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and
>
> -   I will act if the Standard is compromised.
