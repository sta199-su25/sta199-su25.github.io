This is a new statistical model we introduced for modeling a response variable that is binary (categorical with two levels) rather than numerical. If we can do that, then we can use the model for a special kind of prediction called *classification*.\n\n::: callout-note\nThis lab assumes you've completed the labs so far and doesn't repeat setup and overview content from those labs. If you haven't done those yet, you should review the previous labs before starting on this one.\n:::\n\n## Learning objectives\n\nBy the end of the lab, you will...\n\n-   fit, interpret, predict with, and compare logistic regression models;\n-   work with the ROC curve and the area under the ROC curve;\n-   complete a data science assessment.\n\nAnd, as usual, you will also...\n\n-   Get more experience with data science workflow using R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub\n-   Further your reproducible authoring skills with Quarto\n-   Improve your familiarity with version control using Git and GitHub\n\n## Getting started\n\nLog in to RStudio, clone your `lab-5` repo from GitHub, open your `lab-5.qmd` document, and get started!\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Click here if you prefer to see step-by-step instructions\n\n### Step 1: Log in to RStudio\n\n-   Go to <https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers> and log in with your Duke NetID and Password.\n-   Click `STA198-199` under My reservations to log into your container. You should now see the RStudio environment.\n\n### Step 2: Clone the repo & start a new RStudio project\n\n-   Go to the course organization at [github.com/sta199-su25](https://github.com/sta199-su25) organization on GitHub. Click on the repo with the prefix **lab-5**. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the lab.\n\n-   Click on the green **CODE** button and select **Use SSH**. This might already be selected by default; if it is, you'll see the text **Clone with SSH**. Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.\n\n-   In RStudio, go to *File* ➛ *New Project* ➛*Version Control* ➛ *Git*.\n\n-   Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box *Repository URL*. Again, please make sure to have *SSH* highlighted under *Clone* when you copy the address.\n\n-   Click *Create Project*, and the files from your GitHub repo will be displayed in the *Files* pane in RStudio.\n\n-   Click *lab-5.qmd* to open the template Quarto file. This is where you will write up your code and narrative for the lab.\n\n### Step 3: Update the YAML\n\nIn `lab-5.qmd`, update the `author` field to your name, render your document and examine the changes. Then, in the Git pane, click on **Diff** to view your changes, add a commit message (e.g., \"Added author name\"), and click **Commit**. Then, push the changes to your GitHub repository, and in your browser confirm that these changes have indeed propagated to your repository.\n:::\n\n::: callout-important\nIf you run into any issues with the first steps outlined above, flag a TA for help before proceeding.\n:::\n\n## Packages\n\nIn this lab, we will work with the\n\n-   **tidyverse** package for doing data analysis in a \"tidy\" way;\n-   **tidymodels** package for modeling in a \"tidy\" way.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   **Run** the code cell by clicking on the green triangle (play) button for the code cell labeled `load-packages`. This loads the package so that its features (the functions and datasets in it) are accessible from your *Console*.\n-   Then, **render** the document that loads this package to make its features (the functions and datasets in it) available for other code cells in your Quarto document.\n\n## Guidelines\n\nAs we've discussed in lecture, your plots should include an informative title, axes and legends should have human-readable labels, and careful consideration should be given to aesthetic choices.\n\nAdditionally, code should follow the [tidyverse style](https://style.tidyverse.org/).\nParticularly,\n\n-   there should be spaces before and line breaks after each `+` when building a `ggplot`,\n\n-   there should also be spaces before and line breaks after each `|>` in a data transformation pipeline,\n\n-   code should be properly indented,\n\n-   there should be spaces around `=` signs and spaces after commas.\n\nFurthermore, all code should be visible in the PDF output, i.e., should not run off the page on the PDF.\nLong lines that run off the page should be split across multiple lines with line breaks.\n\n::: callout-important\nContinuing to develop a sound workflow for reproducible data analysis is important as you complete the lab and other assignments in this course.\nThere will be periodic reminders in this assignment to remind you to **render, commit, and push** your changes to GitHub.\nYou should have at least 3 commits with meaningful commit messages by the end of the assignment.\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-important\nYou are also expected to pay attention to [code smell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell) in addition to code style and readability. You should review and improve your code to avoid redundant steps (e.g., grouping, ungrouping, and grouping again by the same variable in a pipeline), using inconsistent syntax (e.g., `!` to say \"not\" in one place and `-` in another place), etc.\n:::\n\n# Part 1 - logistic regression\n\nFor this exercise, we will work with hotel cancellations. The data describe the demand of two different types of hotels. Each observation represents a hotel booking between July 1, 2015 and August 31, 2017. Some bookings were cancelled (`is_canceled = 1`) and others were kept, i.e., the guests checked into the hotel (`is_canceled = 0`). You can view the code book for all variables [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-02-11/readme.md).\n\n## Question 1 - data preparation\n\na.  Read the data in with `read_csv()`.\n\nb.  Transform the `is_canceled` variable to be a factor with \"not canceled\" (0) as the first level and \"canceled\" (1) as the second level. Confirm that you were able to successfully transform the variable by running `levels(hotels$is_canceled)`.\n\nc.  Split the data into training (75%) and testing (25%) sets. Report the number of rows in the testing and training sets. **NOTE**: use `set.seed(555)`.\n\n## Question 2 - exploratory analysis\n\na.  In a single pipeline, calculate the mean arrival dates (`arrival_date_day_of_month`) for reservations that were cancelled and reservations that were not cancelled in the training data.\n\nb.  Explore attributes of bookings in the training data and summarize your findings in 5 bullet points. You must provide a visualization or summary supporting each finding. **Note**: This is not meant to be an exhaustive exploration. We anticipate a wide variety of answers to this question.\n\n## Question 3 - fit a simple model\n\na.  Fit the appropriate model to predict whether a reservation was cancelled from `arrival_date_day_of_month` and display a tidy summary of the model output. **Make sure you use only the training data**.\n\nb.  Typeset the fitted regression equation.\n\nc.  Interpret the *slope* coefficient in the context of the data and the research question.\n\nd.  Calculate the probability that a hotel reservation is cancelled if the arrival date is on the 26th of the month. Based on this probability, would you predict this booking would be cancelled or not cancelled. Explain your reasoning for your classification.\n\ne.  Use the `augment` function to generate predictions for every observation **in the test dataset**, and make sure you store the results in a variable with an informative name.\n\nf.  Compute the error rates (TPR, TNR, FPR, FNR) of the classifications you just produced.\n\ng.  Plot the ROC curve for this model and the test data.\n\n::: callout-tip\nSince the level of `is_canceled` we're predicting is the second level, we need to set `event_level = \"second\"` when calculating the ROC curve.\n:::\n\n## Question 4 - fit an alternative model\n\na.  Fit the appropriate model to predict whether a reservation was cancelled from `hotel`, `arrival_date_month`, and `lead_time`, and display a tidy summary of the model output. **Make sure you use only the training data**.\n\nb.  Interpret the *intercept* coefficient in the context of the data and the research question.\n\nc.  Use the `augment` function to generate predictions for every observation **in the test dataset**, and make sure you store the results in a variable with an informative name.\n\nd.  Plot the ROC curve for this model and the test data.\n\n## Question 5 - selecting a model\n\na.  Plot the ROC curves of the models from Question 4 and Question 5 on the same plot, using different colors for each model and a legend that describes which model is represented with which color.\n\nb.  Calculate the AUC (area under the curve) for each model using the `roc_auc()` function.\n\nc.  Based on the results of parts a and b, which model do you prefer? Explain your reasoning.\n\n\n",
